# Conclusion: From Evaluation to Impact

## Why Evaluation Matters in Production

Model evaluation isn’t just a checkbox—it’s the foundation for building robust, responsible, and scalable GenAI systems.

Throughout this workshop, you explored three layers of practical LLM evaluation:

|===
| Layer
| Tool
| Purpose

| **System Performance**
| GuideLLM
| Ensure latency, throughput, and scaling align with SLA and infrastructure costs

| **Task Accuracy**
| lm-eval-harness
| Quantify reasoning quality, factuality, and domain performance

|===

These evaluations aren't theoretical—they directly support:

* **Model selection**: Does it meet your task and performance goals?

* **Deployment readiness**: Can it serve real users under load?

* **Risk mitigation**: Will it behave reliably in edge cases?

## Bringing This to Your Workflow

Ask yourself these questions as you move forward with production LLM systems:

- Have you validated latency and throughput under realistic input/output patterns?

- Do you have domain-relevant benchmarks to assess model fit?

- Is there a safety testing loop in place for model updates?

- Can you track regression and improvement over time as you iterate?

Whether you're fine-tuning a foundation model, deploying a RAG pipeline, or designing agentic workflows - evaluation is your grounding signal.

## Uninstall Deployments

We will be redeploying vLLM and model with different parameters in the next module. To clean up the namespace, run the following command:   

[source,console,role=execute,subs=attributes+]

oc delete namespace rhaiis-demo
