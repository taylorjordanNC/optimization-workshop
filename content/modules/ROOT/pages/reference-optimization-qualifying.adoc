= Enterprise Guide to LLM Optimization and Quantization 

The following document will provide introductory-level content to help you identify, qualify and position LLM optimization and quantization opportunities with our enterprise clients.

[#executive-summary]
== Executive Summary

The exponential growth of Large Language Models has created a fundamental challenge: state-of-the-art AI models are becoming too large and expensive for most organizations to deploy effectively. LLM Compressor addresses this critical gap by powering Red Hat AI's collection of *490+ pre-compressed models*, enabling *2-5X faster inference* while preserving accuracy.

Rather than forcing organizations to navigate complex compression technologies, Red Hat AI provides ready-made compressed models that can be deployed immediately for AI inference without technical complexity.

Consider build your own
RedHat Valideted Model Repository

*Bottom Line:* Deploy fast, cost-efficient AI using pre-optimized models without compression complexity.

[#customer-qualification]
== Customer Qualification

The key to successful LLM compression engagements lies in identifying customers who face specific infrastructure or performance constraints. Experience shows that certain customer statements immediately indicate strong qualification potential, while others suggest the need for more careful evaluation.

=== ‚úÖ Strong Qualification Signals

When customers express these concerns, they represent ideal candidates for compressed model deployment:

* "Our models don't fit on our GPUs"
* "Inference costs are too high" 
* "Response times are too slow"
* "We need to scale but can't buy more hardware"
* "We're hitting memory limits"

=== üéØ High-Value Regulatory Opportunities

These signals indicate premium engagement opportunities with significant ROI potential:

* "We have approved models we can't deploy due to infrastructure costs"
* "Our validated models don't fit on our current GPU clusters"  
* "We need to scale approved models but hardware costs are prohibitive"

=== ‚ö†Ô∏è Proceed with Caution

These statements indicate potential complications that require deeper discovery and careful positioning:

* "We can't accept any accuracy loss" ‚Üí Full-precision discussion
* "We need to modify the compression" ‚Üí Clarify pre-compressed approach

=== Discovery Questions

Effective qualification requires understanding four critical dimensions of customer requirements:

. *Resource Constraints:* "What GPU memory limitations affect your deployment?"
. *Performance Requirements:* "What accuracy thresholds must be maintained?"
. *Scale Requirements:* "What request volume do you need to support?"
. *Hardware Environment:* "What GPU generation supports your infrastructure?"

*Regulatory Discovery:*

* "Do you have approved models you can't currently deploy due to infrastructure constraints?"
* "What would maintaining regulatory approval while reducing infrastructure costs be worth?"
* "How do you currently handle functional equivalence validation for model modifications?"

[#what-is-llm-compressor]
== What is LLM Compressor?
