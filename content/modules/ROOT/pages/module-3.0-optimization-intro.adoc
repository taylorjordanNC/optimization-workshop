= Module 3: vLLM Performance Optimization

== Introduction

With your LLM deployed and benchmarked, it's time to optimize performance for real-world production workloads. This module focuses on maximizing inference efficiency using vLLM tuning techniques that can dramatically improve latency and throughput without requiring additional hardware.

Performance optimization is critical because:

* **User Experience**: Sub-second response times are essential for interactive applications like chatbots and coding assistants
* **Cost Efficiency**: Better performance means serving more users with the same infrastructure, directly reducing per-request costs
* **Scalability**: Optimized models can handle higher concurrent loads without degradation
* **Resource Utilization**: Proper tuning maximizes GPU utilization and minimizes memory waste

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Understand key vLLM performance parameters and their impact on latency/throughput
* Apply systematic optimization techniques to reduce Time To First Token (TTFT)
* Configure memory management and batching for optimal resource utilization  
* Implement performance tuning strategies for chat applications with concurrent users
* Measure and validate optimization improvements using real-world benchmarks

== What You'll Learn

=== Performance Fundamentals
* **Latency vs Throughput**: Understanding the trade-offs and when to optimize for each
* **Time To First Token (TTFT)**: The critical metric for interactive user experience
* **Memory Management**: KV cache optimization and efficient GPU memory utilization
* **Batching Strategies**: Dynamic batching and continuous batching for concurrent requests

=== vLLM Configuration Mastery
* **Engine Parameters**: `max_model_len`, `max_num_seqs`, `block_size` and their performance impact
* **Attention Mechanisms**: PagedAttention configuration for memory efficiency
* **Scheduling**: Request scheduling and queue management optimization
* **GPU Utilization**: Maximizing hardware efficiency through proper configuration
